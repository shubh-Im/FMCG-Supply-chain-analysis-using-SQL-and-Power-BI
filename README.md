# ðŸ“¦ FMCG Supply Chain Service-Level Analysis | AtliQ Mart

This project analyzes the supply chain service performance of AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG company in India, to uncover root causes behind customer dissatisfaction and contract non-renewals. Using SQL and Power BI, the project focuses on key service KPIsâ€”**On-Time (OT%)**, **In-Full (IF%)**, and **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**â€”to track delivery performance and recommend improvements before business expansion.

## ðŸ”¶ Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart, headquartered in Gujarat, is operational in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. Recently, some key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to poor serviceâ€”particularly late deliveries and incomplete orders. 

To address this, the supply chain team decided to monitor the following KPIs for each customer on a daily basis:
- **OT% (On-Time Delivery)**
- **IF% (In-Full Delivery)**
- **OTIF% (On-Time In-Full Delivery)**

This analysis aims to track service performance, identify inefficiencies, and enable data-driven decision-making for future growth.
